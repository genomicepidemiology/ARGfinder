# ARGfinder
A tool for for large-scale analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes and their flanking regions in metagenomic datasets.


##Introduction

ARGfinder is a newly developed snakemake pipeline designed to analyze read distances, abundancies and genomic flanking regions of ARGs in metagenomic sequencing data. It has been adapted to work for short-read sequencing datasets and includes the recently made Panres database, a combined collection of current ARG databases, and ARGextender, an assembly tool for extending the genomic flanking region arouns genes of interest.
